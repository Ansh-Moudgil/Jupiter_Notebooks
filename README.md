## 1. Diabetes Exploratory Data Analysis and prediction(Diabetes_EDA_prediction (2).ipynb)
### Description
# Diabetes EDA and Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that explores and analyzes a diabetes dataset, combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with predictive modeling. The primary goal is to understand the data's structure, identify significant patterns, and develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes status.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:**
  - Summary statistics of the dataset.
  - Insights into distributions, correlations, and trends using visualizations.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling.
  - Feature engineering to enhance model performance.

- **Visualization:**
  - Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to understand feature distributions.
  - Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Implementation of classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

- **Interpretability:**
  - Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of diabetes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

### Python Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-eda-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-eda-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes_EDA_prediction.ipynb
   ```

5. Run the notebook cells to explore the data and train the predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (ÂµU/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function (a measure of genetic influence)
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Diabetes status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Results
- Detailed EDA reveals patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- Machine learning models achieve competitive accuracy in predicting diabetes status.
- Feature importance analysis highlights the most influential predictors.
